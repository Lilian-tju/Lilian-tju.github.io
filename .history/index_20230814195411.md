## News and Updates


- **Aug 2023：**Preparing for the IELTS exam involves first completing fundamental vocabulary memorization and simultaneously studying reading and writing techniques. The anticipated schedule is to take the assessment by the end of September.Fighting!
- **Jul 2023：**Customization of the contrastive loss function has been accomplished, alongside the construction of feature fusion networks for four types of omics data. After a week of optimization, fusion features of dimension 3*100 with substantial informative content have been obtained for survival analysis. Now, the process of drafting the research paper has commenced!
- **Jun 2023：**Cleaning and initial feature screening of three types of omics data (gene expression, methylation, miRNA expression) from TCGAThrough statistical analysis, it has been found that cancer transcriptomic data commonly suffer from sample imbalance. After consulting the literature, two approaches have been identified for addressing this issue: 1) utilizing focal loss, and 2) employing SMOTETomek in the preprocessing stage. Considering the nature of the data, SMOTETomek was selected to achieve sample balancing.
